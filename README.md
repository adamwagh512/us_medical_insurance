## Project Description
This is my first off-platform project for the Data Analysis program for Codecademy. The objective of project was to convert a comma separted values (CSV) sheet into a series of python lists, and use those lists to perform analysis on the data. This is an active project which will be revisited periodically and updated as I learn new technologies.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge the Codecademy Data Analysis program for teaching me the skills necessary to complete this project, as well as providing the dataset for this project.
